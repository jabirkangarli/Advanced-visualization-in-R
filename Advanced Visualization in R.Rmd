## **Data Description**

Data set used for this project was taken from the [dataset repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
It describes income depending on different demographical characteristics.

**Columns:**

* **age**: the age of an individual
Integer greater than 0
* **workclass**: a general term to represent the employment status of an individual
Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.
* **fnlwgt**: this is the number of people the census believes the entry represents.
Integer greater than 0
* **education**: the highest level of education achieved by an individual.
Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.
* **education-num**: the highest level of education achieved in numerical form.
Integer greater than 0
* **marital-status**: marital status of an individual. Married-civ-spouse corresponds to a civilian spouse while Married-AF-spouse is a spouse in the Armed Forces.

Distribution of the age variable. Distribution is right-skewed. The most frequent age is approximately between 30-40 years old. Minimum value for age is 17 and maximum value for age is 90.  Group having income more than 50K is smaller comparing to group with income less than 50K. Group with 50K or more increases with age while group with less than 50K is dropping.   

```{r}

we can see that the biggest age groups in our dataset are "26-35" and "36-50".

```

The biggest group with income equal to or more than 50K is for those who are married. The biggest group that has income less 50K is those that are never married or married.

```

In our data male groups is more represented than female. We have more male respondents with income higher than 50K comparing to female group.   

```{r, message=FALSE}
data1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, fill = income)) + geom_bar(position="dodge") +

           axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "cyan4")) +
  xlab("race") +
  ggtitle("Race vs Income")
```
The most representative race in our data is white where majority has income 50K or less. Other races underrepresented in our data hence they were be combined into one category.  

```{r, message=FALSE}
data1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income, y = hours_per_week, fill = factor(gender))) +

  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Gender")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("0" = "=<50K", "1" = ">50K"))
  
```
On the graphed it is illustrated that group which has income 50K or more works more hours during the week comparing to group which has less than 50K.  

```{r, message=FALSE}

  xlab("years of education") +
  ylab("counts") +
  ggtitle("Counts of Years of Education")
```

On the histogram for years of schooling variable we can notice that the most frequent value is 9 years which corresponds to high school graduation. The maximum value is 16 years and minimum value is 1 year of schooling.   


```{r, message=FALSE}

  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Gender"))
```
We can see that private house service group is the smallest and obviously female percentage is more than men in this field. On the other hand, in Administrative clerical field most of employees are women and it's the field that women works the most, whereas, men mostly work in Craft repair.
 
```{r}

           axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "cyan4")) +
  xlab("income group") +
  ggtitle("Workclass vs Income")
```

Private workclass earn more money in both income group but specifically in low income group, which is <= 50K, their earnings are way higher than other groups. People who work for Federal government are one of the least earners within low income group.

People with Doctorate, Prof school, Bachelor's, Master's degrees tend to earn more which make sense. People with High school graduation earn in the slighly less from people who have some College degrees.

```{r}

```

In general, people with `White` race tend to go after their education more than other races. Whereas, being High School grad is the most popular education type within black race.
